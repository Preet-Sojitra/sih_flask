## Usage:

To use Anuvaad Ratna, you need to run it on your local machine only as of now. To do so, follow these steps:

> You need to clone both the frontend and backend repositories to your local machine separately and start the servers for both of them separately.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Preet-Sojitra/sih_flask
```

2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the server using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

> NOTE: You need to have the model's weights and two other configuration files in the backend repository's `tf_model/` directory . You can download the weights file from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qwYxV5rqJnK_Irz7EX7fwDlSliEttzd0?usp=sharing). Download whole `tf_model/` directory and place it in the backend repository's root directory.

4. Now, head over to the [frontend repository](https://github.com/Preet-Sojitra/AnuvaadRatna) and clone it (if you haven't already).

## Future Plans:

We plan to add support for more languages to Anuvaad Ratna in the future. We also plan to improve the accuracy of the translations and to add new features, such as the ability to translate images.
